# gdq-database
This is a database of all the GDQ runs from 2012 and onward (because the data wasn't easily accessible prior)

## Todos
  - Make a webpage to display the data
  - Correct the times for all the runs so the actual runtimes for each are correct
    - This is going to be a lot of manual effort because time keeping wasn't really done early on
